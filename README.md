# Development of Copper Fiber-Based Composite Bipolar Plates for PEM Fuel Cells  

## **Overview**
This project focuses on the development of polymer composite bipolar plates (BPs) using copper fibers and carbon-based fillers for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). The research aims to address the limitations of conventional BPs by developing a lightweight, cost-effective, and high-performance alternative.

## **Key Features**
- **Materials Used:**
  - Epoxy resin (ER) as a binder
  - Natural flake graphite (NFG) and carbon black (CB) as primary fillers
  - Copper fibers as conductive and mechanical reinforcement
- **Methodology:**
  - Compression molding for fabrication
  - Optimized composition for mechanical and electrical properties
- **Outcomes:**
  - Flexural strength: 43.6 MPa
  - Electrical conductivity: 172 S/cm
  - Hydrophobic nature: Water contact angle of 110.1°

## **Highlights**
- **Research Objectives:**
  - Develop a composite BP using carbon fillers, metallic fibers, and conductive polymer.
  - Study the effect of copper fiber length on electrical and mechanical properties.
  - Characterize the developed composite for key metrics like conductivity, hardness, and water absorption.

- **Applications:**
  - Portable fuel cells
  - Electric vehicles
  - Stationary PEMFC applications

## **Technical Specifications**
| Property              | Value                |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Copper Fiber Length   | Optimized at 3 mm   |
| Electrical Conductivity | 172 S/cm           |
| Flexural Strength     | 43.6 MPa            |
| Shore D Hardness      | 66.5                |
| Bulk Density          | 2.44 g/cm³         |

## **Methodology**
1. **Preparation:**
   - Materials were mixed via ball milling and high-speed mixing.
   - The composite was molded under 20 MPa pressure and cured at 65°C.
2. **Testing:**
   - Conductivity: Four-probe method
   - Flexural Strength: Three-point bending test
   - Hardness: Shore D Durometer
   - Water Absorption and Contact Angle tests

## **Results**
- **Electrical Properties:** Optimized fiber length (3 mm) achieved superior conductivity due to uniform filler distribution.
- **Mechanical Properties:** Improved stress distribution with longer fibers increased flexural strength.
- **Hydrophobicity:** High contact angle makes the composite resistant to water absorption.

## **Future Scope**
- Investigating corrosion-resistant metal-based PCCBP.
- Utilizing specialized conductive resins for improved results.
